## About The Project

This project is an exploration into persona adoption for Large Language Models (LLMs) and the creation of engaging, multimodal educational content. The goal was to build a complete, end-to-end system that could take a complex topic as input and produce a video explanation delivered by a well-defined AI character.

The chosen persona, Rick Sanchez, provides a unique challenge in capturing a complex mix of scientific genius, cynicism, and distinct speech patterns. This project demonstrates a full-stack AI workflow, from data collection and model fine-tuning to the final integration of voice and video synthesis.

## Project Architecture

The system is designed as a modular pipeline, where the output of one stage becomes the input for the next. This allows for independent testing and improvement of each component.
